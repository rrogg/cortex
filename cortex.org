* Track Loading Time of Cortex

Starting Emacs has to be as quick as possible. In order to evaluate the time it
takes to load Cortex, someone has to blow the whistle and start the stopwatch.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defvar my-cortex-start-time (current-time) "Time when Cortex was started")
#+END_SRC

* Wrap Lines at a Reasonable Width

Long lines of text have to be wrapped at a width of 80 characters. In order to
leave long code lines untouched, automatic line wrap is only active in
=text-mode= and modes which inherit from =text-mode=, like e.g. =org-mode=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default fill-column 80)
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'auto-fill-mode)
#+END_SRC

* Final Spurt

This is the end of Cortex. Let's see how much time it took to load all of the
shenanigans. Write the result to the =Messages= buffer.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(message "→★ Finished loading Cortex in %.2fs" (float-time (time-subtract (current-time) my-cortex-start-time)))
#+END_SRC
